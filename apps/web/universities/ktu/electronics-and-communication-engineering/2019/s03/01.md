# ECT201: Solid State Devices

## Course Objectives

- To understand the energy band structure of semiconductors and how doping affects electrical properties.  
- To analyze carrier transport mechanisms including drift and diffusion.  
- To examine the working and characteristics of pn junctions and bipolar junction transistors.
