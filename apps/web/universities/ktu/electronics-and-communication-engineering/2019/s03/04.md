# ECT205: Network Theory

## Course Objectives

- To introduce the fundamental concepts of electrical network analysis.
- To apply circuit theorems and Laplace transforms for transient and steady-state analysis.
- To analyze single-port and two-port networks using network functions and parameters.

## Course Outcomes

- Apply Mesh / Node analysis or Network Theorems to obtain steady state response of the linear time invariant networks.  
- Apply Laplace Transforms to determine the transient behaviour of RLC networks.  
- Apply Network functions and Network Parameters to analyse the single port and two port networks.
