# EST102: Programming in C

## Course Objectives

- Analyze a computational problem and develop an algorithm/flowchart to find its solution.
- Develop readable C programs with branching and looping statements using Arithmetic, Logical, Relational, or Bitwise operators.
- Write readable C programs with arrays, structure, or union for storing and processing data.
- Divide a computational problem into modules and develop readable multi-function C programs using recursion if required.
- Write readable C programs using pointers for array processing and parameter passing.
- Develop readable C programs with files for reading input and storing output.

## Course Outcomes

- Analyze a computational problem and develop an algorithm/flowchart to find its solution.  
- Develop readable C programs with branching and looping statements, which use Arithmetic, Logical, Relational, or Bitwise operators.  
- Write readable C programs with arrays, structure, or union for storing the data to be processed.  
- Divide a given computational problem into a number of modules and develop a readable multi-function C program using recursion if required to find the solution.  
- Write readable C programs which use pointers for array processing and parameter passing.  
- Develop readable C programs with files for reading input and storing output.

## Course Content

### Module I: Basics of Computer Hardware and Software

- Basics of Computer Architecture: Processor, Memory, Input & Output devices.
- Application Software & System Software: Compilers, Interpreters, High-level and Low-level languages.
- Introduction to structured approach to programming.
- Flowcharts, Algorithms, Pseudocode (Bubble Sort, Linear Search â€“ Algorithms and Pseudocode).

### Module II: Program Basics

- Basic structure of C program: Character set, Tokens, Identifiers in C, Variables and Data Types, Constants.
- Console IO Operations: `printf` and `scanf`.
- Operators and Expressions: Arithmetic, Relational, Logical, Conditional, Assignment, Bitwise, `sizeof` operator.
- Operator Precedence.
- Control Flow Statements: `if`, `switch`, `goto`, `while`, `do-while`, `for`, `break`, `continue`.
- Simple programs covering control flow.

### Module III: Arrays and Strings

- Array Declaration and Initialization: 1-Dimensional and 2-Dimensional Arrays.
- String Processing: In-built string handling functions (`strlen`, `strcpy`, `strcat`, `strcmp`, `puts`, `gets`).
- Sample programs: Linear Search, Bubble Sort, and simple programs with arrays and strings.

### Module IV: Working with Functions

- Modular Programming: Writing functions, Formal and Actual Parameters.
- Call by Value, Recursion, Arrays as Function Parameters.
- Structure, Union, Storage Classes, Scope and Lifetime of Variables.
- Simple programs using functions.

### Module V: Pointers and Files

- Basics of Pointers: Declaring pointers, Accessing data through pointers, NULL pointer.
- Array Access using pointers, Pass-by-reference effect.
- File Operations: Open, Close, Read, Write, Append.
- Sequential and Random access to files.
- In-built file handling functions: `rewind()`, `fseek()`, `ftell()`, `feof()`, `fread()`, `fwrite()`.
- Simple programs covering pointers and files.
