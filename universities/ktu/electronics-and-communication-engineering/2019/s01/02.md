# PHT110: Engineering Physics B

## Course Objectives 
- To provide a strong foundation in basic physics concepts relevant to engineering. 
- To impart an understanding of wave optics, quantum mechanics, semiconductor physics, and superconductivity. 
- To develop skills to apply physical principles in practical devices and modern technology.

## Course Outcomes
- Compute the quantitative aspects of waves and oscillations in engineering systems.  
- Apply the interaction of light with matter through interference, diffraction and identify these phenomena in different natural optical processes and optical instruments.  
- Analyze the behaviour of matter in the atomic and subatomic level through the principles of quantum mechanics to perceive the microscopic processes in electronic devices.  
- Apply the knowledge of ultrasonics in non-destructive testing and use the principles of acoustics to explain the nature and characterization of acoustic design and to provide a safe and healthy environment.  
- Apply the comprehended knowledge about laser and fibre optic communication systems in various engineering applications.
